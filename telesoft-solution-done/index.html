<!--    Assignment for "Telesoftas" Sent by Ieva 
        Completed by Norbertas Petreikis, 2018

    ##Description of task can be found within README file. Tried to complete it with as much Pure JS as I could implementing different approaches..
    .. to show that I know a thing or two about pure JS, however I am way more familiar with frameworks.

    - Since I had noone to really ask how/what/in which prefered way should things be done, I pretty much did it out of my head over the course of couple hours~
    .. only guidance being the provided PDF, which showcased some design elements to get the idea how it should be done.
    
    .. Tried my best at replicating that as closely as I could while keeping it pretty basic as that is what I guess ?? was the requirement.
    
    - If at any point this seems ridicilously too simple, I am more than happy to re-do the assignment the "correct way"
    What I mean by that:

        -Possibly build this with a framework (Working with React at the moment, so my prefernce of course.).
        -Use some libraries like Semantic-Ui / Bootstrap
        -At least include the local storage so it actually serves as a todo list.
        -Remove/edit functionality.
        -Responsivness as at the moment there's zero to none of that 
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ##All of the above was once again not implemented due to that fact that I believe it was ment to be kept simple, yet interesting to mess around with pure JS :)
